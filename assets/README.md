# <Pre-Work Study Guide Webpage>

## Description

This is a beginning study guide to dip our toes into web development. Through this work, we learned a bit about HTML, CSS, Git, and Javascript. This was a really helpul first step in understanding what coding actually is and to not be intimidated about a wall of code. Through this course, we'll be able to continue improving this study guide.

Badges aren't necessary, but they demonstrate street cred. Badges let other developers know that you know what you're doing. Check out the badges hosted by [shields.io](https://shields.io/). You may not understand what they all represent now, but you will in time.

## Features

If your project has a lot of features, list them here.

## How to Contribute

If you created an application or package and would like other developers to contribute to it, you can include guidelines for how to do so. The [Contributor Covenant](https://www.contributor-covenant.org/) is an industry standard, but you can always write your own if you'd prefer.

## Tests

Go the extra mile and write tests for your application. Then provide examples on how to run them here.
